Personal dotfiles, [managed with GNU Stow] [1]. Inspiration (and, in many
cases, actual code):

* [Mathias Bynens's dotfiles] [2]
* [Seth House's `.pythonrc`] [3]
* [256-colour mode for GNU screen] [4]
* [Python and Vim] [5]

To install the dotfiles, install [GNU stow] [6] and run:

`stow bash curl git python screen system`
